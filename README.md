# 86BUTTDROP

86BUTTDROP is my attempt at gaining headroom on the "gen2" Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR86 cars by lowering the stock seat.

After multiple iterations, I settled on a design that lowers the seat by about 18 mm, which provides a very noticable increase in headroom.
It might be possible to modify the parts to lower the seat a bit further, but will require cutting OEM parts, so I've decided to not do it for now.

## Support the project

I've spent over $750 on multiple iterations of prototype parts, and countless hours pulling the seat out,
measuring things, testing fitment, and putting the seat back in back in. I also had to go to a chiropractor
a few times \:)

While I'm sharing the results with you for free, I would really appreciate donations to help me offset
the costs, and motivate me to work on more projects like this in the future.

## Overview

The kit consists of three metal brackets bolted together, to the factory seat, and to the floor.

The kit replaces the factory seat slider mechanism, so you will need to use different parts depending
on the amount of legroom you need. The seat will retain the height adjustment mechanism, and moves the
seat a bit forward as it raises it, so if you share the car with someone within an inch or two from you,
you might be able to adjust the legroom down a bit for the shorter person.
